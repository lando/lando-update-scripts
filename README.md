## Lando Bulk Update Scripts

There are a lot of Lando plugins. Sometimes we need to make small changes to all of them; these scripts are starting points for ad-hoc scripts to assist in that.

As we gain more independent maintainers for them this should be less necessary and hopefully obsolete.

Effectively these are only useful to a Lando org admin.
